To compile programs in C, first create the file with "file\_name.c" and in the same work space location, open up the terinal and type
\begin{verbatim}
gcc -o executable_name file_name.c -lwiringPi
\end{verbatim}
where "executable\_name" is the name of the executable that is to be created from the C program. this is usually the same as the file name. an example would be that for "blink.c", the executable could also be called "blink" and the corresponding compilation command would be
\begin{verbatim}
gcc -o blink blink.c -lwiringPi
\end{verbatim}
Note that "-lwiringPi" is to account for the inclusion of the third party library "wiringPi.h".\\\\ To execute the file use
\begin{verbatim}
./executable_name
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
sudo ./executable_name
\end{verbatim}
